### Lab 5: My First Python Program

#### Objective

In this lab, you will write a simple and personalized Python program to
demonstrate your understanding of fundamental programming concepts like
**variables**, **input**, and **output**. We'll make it fun by having the
program act as a simple "about me" assistant.

-----

#### Introduction

Programming isn't just for computer scientists—it's a way to tell a computer
exactly what you want it to do. In this lab, you'll learn how to use a few
simple lines of code to create a program that can interact with the user, store
information in a **variable**, and display a message. This hands-on project
will show you that even a small program can be powerful and fun to create.

-----

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
You will need a Python interpreter. The easiest way to get started is to use a
free online tool like **Replit** (`replit.com`) or **Google Colab**
(`colab.research.google.com`). These tools let you write and run Python code
directly in your web browser without installing anything.

**Step 2: The Code\!**
Your program will ask the user a few questions and then use that information to
create a personalized message. In the online tool's editor, copy and paste the
code below and then fill in the blanks as instructed.

```python
# Part 1: Ask the user for their name and a fun fact.
# The `input()` function prompts the user for information.
# The information is then stored in a "variable" with a descriptive name.
name = input("Hi there! What's your name? ")
fun_fact = input("That's a cool name! Now, tell me a fun fact about yourself: ")

# Part 2: Display the information back to the user in a personalized message.
# The `print()` function displays a message to the user.
# We'll combine the user's input with a personalized message.
print("------------------------------------------")
print("I've created a little summary about you!")
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Fun Fact: {fun_fact}")
print("It's nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
print("------------------------------------------")

# Now, add your own creative touch!
# Add a new variable and a new input() prompt to ask the user one more question.
# Then, add a new print() line to display the new information.
# Example ideas: favorite food, favorite color, favorite animal, etc.
# Write your code here:

```

**Step 3: Run the Program**
Click the "Run" button in the online editor. The program will prompt you for
your name and fun fact. Enter your information and see how the program
responds. Then, after you've written your own code in Part 3, run the program
again to see your new custom line appear\!

**Step 4: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your experience.

1.  What is the purpose of a **variable** in this program?
2.  What is the purpose of the `input()` function, and what is the purpose of the `print()` function?
3.  Describe the extra code you wrote for Part 3. What question did you ask, and how did you display the answer?

**Step 5: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save a copy of your Python code and your
answers in a document and submit it as instructed.

#### Good luck, and have fun coding\!
