**Random Access Memory (RAM)** 🧠 is a type of volatile computer memory that
temporarily stores data and instructions for the CPU to access quickly. Think
of it as a computer’s short-term memory or a workspace on your desk. When you
open an application or a file, the computer loads it from your long-term
storage (like a hard drive or SSD) into the RAM. This allows the CPU to access
the data much faster than it could from the slower, permanent storage, which is
why a computer with more RAM can run more programs smoothly at the same time.
However, RAM is **volatile**, meaning it loses all its information when the
computer is turned off.

In a modern computer, RAM comes in the form of a small circuit board called a
**memory module** or **stick**. These sticks are inserted into specific slots
on the **motherboard**, where they are connected to the CPU. The CPU constantly
reads and writes information to the RAM while the computer is running. For
example, when you're editing a document, the program and your current changes
are stored in RAM. When you save the document, the data is moved from the fast,
temporary RAM to the slower, permanent storage on your hard drive. The more RAM
a computer has, the more "workspace" it has for running applications and
handling large files, which is crucial for tasks like gaming, video editing, or
having many browser tabs open at once.

The performance of RAM is measured by its **capacity** (how much data it can
hold, measured in gigabytes or GB) and its **speed** (how fast it can transfer
data, measured in megahertz or MHz). Higher capacity allows you to run more
applications simultaneously without the computer slowing down, as it prevents
the system from having to constantly move data between RAM and the much slower
storage. Higher speed, on the other hand, allows the CPU to access data in RAM
faster, leading to a more responsive feel.  Choosing the right amount and type
of RAM is essential for a computer's overall performance, as it directly
impacts how quickly and efficiently the CPU can do its job.
