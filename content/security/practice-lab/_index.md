### Lab 4: Your Digital Footprint & Online Privacy

#### Objective
In this lab, you will become a digital detective! You'll investigate your own
online presence, identify potential privacy risks, and then take proactive
steps to secure your personal data by installing essential privacy tools.

---

#### Introduction
Everything you do online—from social media posts to website visits—leaves a
trail. This is your **digital footprint**. Just as important as what you post
is how you protect yourself from the things you don't even see. Malicious
websites, trackers, and hidden ads can all compromise your privacy and
security. Your task today is to take back control by cleaning up your digital
footprint and installing a privacy toolkit for your primary web browser.

---

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Audit Your Digital Footprint**
Let's see what the internet knows about you!

1.  Open a search engine and search for your full name.
2.  Review the first few pages of search results. Do you find old social media profiles, forum posts, or other information you had forgotten about?
3.  Write down a brief summary of what you found. 

**Step 2: Password Checkup**
Now, let's make sure your passwords are up to snuff.

1.  Open your primary web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
2.  Navigate to your browser's password manager and look for a security checkup feature. (On Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/passwords` and click "Check passwords").
3.  Run the checkup. Write down how many of your passwords were found to be weak or compromised. You'll work on fixing these later. 

**Step 3: Install Your Privacy Toolkit**
This is where we get proactive! Follow these steps to install two essential
tools.

1.  **Ad-Blocker:** Go to your browser's extension store and install an ad-blocker like **uBlock Origin**. An ad-blocker prevents many ads from loading, which speeds up your browsing and, more importantly, blocks many malicious scripts and trackers.
2.  **Privacy Extension:** Next, install a privacy-focused extension like **Privacy Badger**. This tool learns to block invisible trackers that try to follow you across different websites.

**Step 4: Answer the Questions**
Based on your investigation, answer the following questions.

1.  What did you find most surprising about your digital footprint?
2.  How many of your passwords were flagged as weak or compromised? What is your plan to fix them?
3.  In your own words, explain how an ad-blocker helps with cybersecurity.

**Step 5: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings in a text file or a
document and submit it as instructed.

### Bonus Lab: The DNS Firewall Challenge

Want to take your privacy to the next level? A DNS (Domain Name System)
firewall blocks malicious websites before they even load. Let's set up a free
one from Quad9.

* **What is a DNS Firewall?** When you type a website name (like `google.com`) into your browser, your computer asks a DNS server for the website's IP address. A DNS firewall checks if that IP address is associated with any known malicious sites and, if so, blocks the request.
* **The Quad9 DNS Server:** Use these two IP addresses for the servers: `9.9.9.9` and `149.112.112.112`.

#### Instructions

1.  **Choose a Device:** Pick a device you want to secure (desktop, laptop, or mobile).
2.  **Locate DNS Settings:** Find the DNS settings for your device. 
    * **On Windows:** Go to "Network & Internet Settings," then "Change adapter options," right-click your network, and go to "Properties."
    * **On macOS:** Go to "System Settings," then "Network," and find the "DNS Servers" section.
    * **On Mobile:** Look in your Wi-Fi settings for a "Modify Network" option.
3.  **Enter the Addresses:** Change the DNS server addresses to `9.9.9.9` and `149.112.112.112`.
4.  **Test It:** To confirm it's working, try to visit a known malicious website (you can find lists of these online or ask your instructor for a safe test link). The site should not load, and you should see an error message.

#### Good luck, and happy sleuthing!
