**Phishing** is a form of cyberattack that relies on "social engineering"—the
psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging
confidential information. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets software
vulnerabilities, phishing targets human vulnerabilities: curiosity, fear, and
the desire to be helpful. The attacker masquerades as a trusted entity, such as
a bank, a colleague, or a popular service like Netflix, to trick the victim
into handing over passwords, credit card numbers, or sensitive corporate data.
Because it bypasses technical defenses by exploiting human trust, phishing
remains the most prevalent entry point for security breaches worldwide.

The most common variation is **bulk phishing**, often referred to as "spray and
pray." In this scenario, attackers send thousands of generic emails hoping a
small percentage of recipients will bite. These messages typically manufacture
a crisis, claiming that your account has been "locked due to suspicious
activity" or that a "payment has failed." The goal is to induce panic so that
you click a link without thinking. This link directs you to a fraudulent
website that is visually identical to the real one.  Once you enter your
credentials on the fake site, the attacker captures them instantly and
redirects you to the real site to avoid raising suspicion.

A more dangerous evolution of this threat is **spear phishing**. Unlike bulk
attacks, spear phishing is highly targeted. The attacker researches the
specific victim using public social media profiles (LinkedIn, Facebook) to
gather details like their job title, friends' names, or recent events. They
then craft a personalized message that references these real-world details,
making the email appear highly legitimate. A specific subset of this is
"Whaling" or Business Email Compromise (BEC), where attackers impersonate
high-level executives (like a CEO) to trick employees into authorizing wire
transfers or revealing tax information, exploiting the employee's reluctance to
question authority.

Phishing has also migrated beyond email into our pockets through **Smishing**
(SMS phishing) and **Vishing** (Voice phishing). Smishing attacks arrive as
text messages, often posing as delivery services (e.g., "UPS: We cannot deliver
your package due to an incomplete address") or banks asking you to verify a
transaction. These are particularly effective because people tend to trust text
messages more than email, and mobile interfaces make it difficult to inspect
the destination URL before clicking. Vishing involves automated robocalls or
live scammers claiming to be from the IRS or tech support, using aggressive
language to pressure victims into paying non-existent debts or granting remote
access to their computers.

Detecting these attacks requires a shift from passive reading to active
scrutiny. The most reliable detection method is the "hover test": on a
computer, hovering your mouse cursor over a link without clicking it will
reveal the actual destination URL. If an email claims to be from "Apple
Support" but the link leads to `support-apple-security-check.xyz`, it is a
scam. Furthermore, analyze the emotional tone of the message. Legitimate
organizations rarely demand immediate action or threaten severe consequences
(like arrest or account deletion) via email. If a message makes you feel a
sudden spike of fear or urgency, treat it as a red flag, pause, and verify the
claim by contacting the entity directly through a trusted phone number or
official website.
