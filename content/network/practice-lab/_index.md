### Lab 3: Home Network Investigation

#### Objective
In this lab, you will explore the core concepts of computer networking in a
practical way by logging into and investigating your own home router's
settings. You'll become familiar with Wi-Fi security, the local IP address
landscape, and DNS settings.

---

#### Introduction
The internet is a vast and complex network, but the "front door" to it all is
your home router. It's the traffic controller that manages all the devices on
your local network (LAN) and connects them to the wider internet. Understanding
how to navigate and manage your router's settings is a fundamental skill for
anyone who wants to have a more secure and efficient network.

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
Before you begin, make sure you have access to a device (computer or
smartphone) connected to your home Wi-Fi network. You will also need to locate
your router's login information. This is often printed on a sticker on the
bottom or back of the router itself. It will include a login URL (e.g.,
`192.168.1.1` or `routerlogin.net`), a username, and a password.

**Step 2: Log In to Your Router**
* Open a web browser on your connected device.
* In the address bar, type the login URL for your router and press Enter.
* When prompted, enter the username and password from the sticker on your router to log in.

**Step 3: Investigate Your Wi-Fi Security**
Navigate to the Wi-Fi or Wireless section of your router's settings. Find the
following information:

* **Security Type:** Note the type of security protocol being used (e.g., WPA2, WPA3). Write down what each of these protocols means for security. 
* **Wi-Fi Password:** Locate your Wi-Fi password. (Do not share this with anyone!)

**Step 4: Explore Your LAN Settings**
Find the LAN or Local Network settings page. This section will show you the IP
addresses of all the devices currently connected to your network.

* **DHCP vs. Static:** Identify if your router is assigning IP addresses dynamically (DHCP) or if any devices have been assigned a static IP.
* **Connected Devices:** Make a list of all the devices currently connected to your network by their IP address and, if available, their name. You may be surprised by what you find!

**Step 5: Check Your DNS Settings**
Find the DNS (Domain Name System) settings. This setting tells your router what
server to use to translate domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses.

* **DNS Servers:** Note the IP addresses of the primary and secondary DNS servers.

**Step 6: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your investigation.

1.  Based on your findings, what is your router's Wi-Fi security protocol? Briefly explain why this is an important security feature.
2.  How many devices did you find on your local network? Were there any unexpected devices on the list?
3.  Why do you think it is important to have both a primary and a secondary DNS server?

**Step 7: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings in a text file or a
document and submit it as instructed.

#### Good luck, and happy networking!
