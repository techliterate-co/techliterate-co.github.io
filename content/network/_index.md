Computer networking is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices
to enable them to communicate, share resources, and exchange data using a
common system of rules, called communication protocols. These networks can vary
in size, from small local area networks (LANs) connecting devices in a single
room to global wide area networks (WANs) like the internet, and they rely on
hardware (like cables and routers) and software to establish connections and
transmit information wirelessly or through physical links.
