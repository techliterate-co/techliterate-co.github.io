**Wi-Fi** is the technology that lets devices connect to a network without
cables. Instead of running Ethernet cords to every corner of your house or
office, a Wi-Fi router uses radio waves to broadcast a signal that laptops,
smartphones, tablets, and smart home devices can join. The result is
convenience—being able to move freely with your device while staying connected.
For most people today, “the internet” is practically synonymous with “Wi-Fi,”
even though Wi-Fi is just the bridge between your device and the internet.

Wi-Fi works by dividing its radio signal into **frequency bands**, most
commonly 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz band has longer range and better wall
penetration, while 5 GHz offers faster speeds but over shorter distances.
Modern routers often provide both, letting devices choose whichever works best.
Newer versions like **Wi-Fi 6** and **Wi-Fi 6E** add efficiency, more capacity
for crowded environments, and even a new 6 GHz band for faster connections.

One of Wi-Fi’s strengths is how easily it supports **multiple devices** at
once. A single household can have a dozen or more devices—from TVs to
thermostats—all connected through one Wi-Fi router. However, this convenience
comes with trade-offs. Congestion can slow speeds, and interference from
neighbors’ networks or even household appliances (like microwaves) can cause
dropped signals. That’s why understanding Wi-Fi basics helps you improve
reliability at home and troubleshoot issues at work.

Wi-Fi also introduces unique **security concerns**. If your network is open or
uses weak encryption, outsiders could connect to it without your knowledge,
potentially eavesdropping on traffic or using your bandwidth. Modern standards
like WPA2 and WPA3 help protect connections, but only if you set strong
passwords and keep your router firmware updated. Public Wi-Fi in coffee shops,
airports, and hotels is especially risky, since you don’t control who else is
connected—making VPNs and cautious browsing valuable in those settings.

For learners, the main takeaway is that Wi-Fi is **wireless convenience with
strings attached**. It gives you flexibility and mobility, but it also requires
awareness of range, speed, interference, and security. By the end of this
section, you should feel comfortable explaining how Wi-Fi works, why one band
might be faster than another, and how to keep your home or office network both
reliable and safe. With this understanding, you’ll be better prepared to handle
the everyday frustrations and advantages of wireless networking.
