### Lab 6: The IoT Home Audit

#### Objective
In this lab, you will perform a security and connectivity audit of the IoT
(Internet of Things) devices in your home. You'll identify what they are, what
data they collect, and confirm they are up-to-date and connected to the
network. This will help you understand the scale and security considerations of
the IoT ecosystem.

---

#### Introduction
Our homes are becoming smarter every day, thanks to a growing number of devices
that connect to the internet. From smart speakers to thermostats and cameras,
the **Internet of Things (IoT)** is all around us. But this convenience comes
with responsibility. It's crucial to know what devices are on your network, how
they are connected, and if they are secure. Your task is to inventory and audit
the IoT devices in your own home.

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Inventory Your IoT Devices**
Walk through your home and identify all the smart devices that connect to your
Wi-Fi network. This might include:

* **Smart Assistants:** Google Home, Amazon Echo
* **Smart Cameras & Doorbells:** Nest, Ring
* **Smart Thermostats & Lighting:** Nest, Ecobee, Philips Hue
* **Networking Devices:** Google Wi-Fi mesh points, smart routers
* **Other Devices:** Smart TVs, smart refrigerators, etc.
Create a list of all the devices you find. 

**Step 2: Audit Each Device's Status**
For each device you identified in Step 1, try to find the following
information. You'll likely need to use its dedicated mobile app to find these
details.

* **Connectivity:** Is the device currently connected and working?
* **Updates/Patches:** Check the device's settings to see if it is running the latest software version. Most apps will have a "Software Update" or "About" section where you can check for and apply any patches.
* **Data Collection:** What type of data does this device collect (e.g., video, audio, temperature, location)?

**Step 3: Advanced Check (Bonus)**
For an extra challenge, investigate if any of your devices allow you to change
the DNS settings. If you can, go to the device's network settings and manually
change the DNS servers to **Quad9's** secure servers (`9.9.9.9` and
`149.112.112.112`). This will help protect the device from communicating with
known malicious websites.

**Step 4: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your audit.

1.  How many IoT devices did you find in your home? Were there any that you were surprised to find?
2.  Did you find any devices that had pending software updates? Why is it important to apply these patches?
3.  Choose one of your devices and describe the kind of data it collects. What are the privacy implications of this data collection?

**Step 5: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings and your answers in a
document and submit it as instructed.

#### Good luck, and happy auditing!
