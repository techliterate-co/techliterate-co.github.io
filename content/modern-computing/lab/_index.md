### Lab 1: Your Computer's Anatomy

#### Objective
In this lab, you will become a hardware investigator! You'll apply the definitions and concepts we've discussed to your own computer by identifying its core components, including the CPU, RAM, storage, and operating system. This hands-on experience will help you connect the theory of computing fundamentals to the machine you use every day.

---

#### Introduction
Think of your computer as a living thing. It has a brain (the **CPU**), a short-term memory (**RAM**), a long-term memory (**storage**), and a nervous system (the **motherboard** and **I/O**). It also has an **operating system (OS)** that tells all the parts how to work together. Your task is to look under the hood of your own computer to find out exactly what makes it tick.

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
Before you begin, make sure you have access to your own computer (a desktop or a laptop will work perfectly). We'll be using built-in system tools, so you don't need to download anything new.

**Step 2: Find Your System Information**
* **On Windows:** Type "System Information" into the Windows search bar and press Enter. This will open a detailed overview of your computer's hardware and software. 
* **On macOS:** Click the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen, then select "About This Mac." This will open a window with a summary of your system. You can click on the "System Report..." button for more details.

**Step 3: Identify the Key Components**
In the system information window you've opened, find the following items and write them down. Your findings will be submitted to your instructor at the end of the lab.

* **Make and Model:** Find the manufacturer and the specific model name of your computer (e.g., "Dell XPS 13" or "MacBook Air").
* **CPU (Processor):** Look for the line that lists your processor. Write down the full name, including the brand (Intel or AMD), the model name (e.g., Core i7, Ryzen 5), and the clock speed (e.g., 3.0 GHz).
* **RAM (Installed Physical Memory):** Find the amount of installed RAM, usually measured in gigabytes (GB).
* **Storage (Drives):** Look for a list of your storage drives. Identify the type (**HDD** or **SSD**) and the capacity (e.g., 512 GB SSD).
* **Operating System:** Find the name and version of your operating system (e.g., "Windows 11 Home" or "macOS Ventura").

**Step 4: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your findings and what you've learned in class.

1.  Based on your research, do you think your computer is more suited for everyday tasks or for demanding tasks like gaming or video editing? Explain your reasoning by referencing the specifications you found.
2.  If you wanted to improve your computer's ability to run more programs at once, what component would you consider upgrading?
3.  Would you expect your computer to be quieter than a similar machine from 20 years ago? Why or why not?

**Step 5: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings in a text file or a document and submit it as instructed.

#### Good luck, and have fun getting to know your machine!
