### Lab 1: Your Computer's Anatomy

#### Objective
In this lab, you will become a hardware investigator! You'll apply the definitions and concepts we've discussed to your own computer by identifying its core components, including the CPU, RAM, storage, and operating system. This hands-on experience will help you connect the theory of computing fundamentals to the machine you use every day.

---

#### Introduction
Think of your computer as a living thing. It has a brain (the **CPU**), a short-term memory (**RAM**), a long-term memory (**storage**), and a nervous system (the **motherboard** and **I/O**). It also has an **operating system (OS)** that tells all the parts how to work together. Your task is to look under the hood of your own computer to find out exactly what makes it tick.

---

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
Before you begin, make sure you have access to your own computer (a desktop or a laptop will work perfectly). We'll be using built-in system tools, so you don't need to download anything new.

**Step 2: Find Your System Information**
* **On Windows:** Type "System Information" into the Windows search bar and press Enter. This will open a detailed overview of your computer's hardware and software. 
* **On macOS:** Click the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen, then select "About This Mac." This will open a window with a summary of your system. You can click on the "System Report..." button for more details.

**Step 3: Identify the Key Components**
In the system information window you've opened, find the following items and write them down. Your findings will be submitted to your instructor at the end of the lab.

* **Make and Model:** Find the manufacturer and the specific model name of your computer (e.g., "Dell XPS 13" or "MacBook Air").
* **CPU (Processor):** Look for the line that lists your processor. Write down the full name, including the brand (Intel or AMD), the model name (e.g., Core i7, Ryzen 5), and the clock speed (e.g., 3.0 GHz).
* **RAM (Installed Physical Memory):** Find the amount of installed RAM, usually measured in gigabytes (GB).
* **Storage (Drives):** Look for a list of your storage drives. Identify the type (**HDD** or **SSD**) and the capacity (e.g., 512 GB SSD).
* **Operating System:** Find the name and version of your operating system (e.g., "Windows 11 Home" or "macOS Ventura").

**Step 4: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your findings and what you've learned in class.

1.  Based on your research, do you think your computer is more suited for everyday tasks or for demanding tasks like gaming or video editing? Explain your reasoning by referencing the specifications you found.
2.  If you wanted to improve your computer's ability to run more programs at once, what component would you consider upgrading?
3.  Would you expect your computer to be quieter than a similar machine from 20 years ago? Why or why not?

**Step 5: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings in a text file or a document and submit it as instructed.

### Lab 2: Mobile Security & Updates

#### Objective
In this lab, you'll learn the critical importance of keeping your mobile device
and its applications up to date. You will check for, and apply, all available
operating system and app updates to ensure your device is patched and secure.

---

#### Introduction
Think of your phone's software as its immune system. When a bug or a security
flaw is found, developers release a "patch" to fix the problem. Staying up to
date is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself from
security threats and ensure your device runs as smoothly as possible. Your task
is to perform a full security and performance checkup on your mobile device.

---

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
Before you begin, make sure you have your mobile device and a strong Wi-Fi
connection. It's a good idea to plug your device into a charger as well, as
some updates can take a while and drain your battery.

**Step 2: Update Your Operating System**
* **On Android:** Go to "Settings," scroll down to "System" or "About Phone," then tap "System Update" or "Software Update." The exact path may vary slightly by manufacturer.
* **On iOS:** Go to "Settings," tap "General," and then select "Software Update."
* Follow the on-screen instructions to check for and install any available updates. This process may require you to restart your device. 

**Step 3: Update Your Applications**
* **On Android:** Open the "Google Play Store" app. Tap your profile icon (in the top right), then select "Manage apps & devices." You should see an option to update all apps or a list of apps with available updates.
* **On iOS:** Open the "App Store" app. Tap your profile icon (in the top right). Scroll down to see pending updates.
* Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install all pending application updates.

**Step 4: Verify Your Status**
After all updates have been installed, go back to the software update section
of your settings (Step 2) and confirm that your device is up to date. Then, go
back to the app store update section (Step 3) and confirm that all of your apps
are also up to date.

**Step 5: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your experience during the
lab.

1.  What operating system and version did your phone have before the update, and what version did it have after?
2.  How many applications did you have to update? Were there any apps you were surprised to see needed an update?
3.  Based on this lab, why do you think it is so important for people to turn on automatic updates for their devices and applications?

**Step 6: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings in a text file or a
document and submit it as instructed.
