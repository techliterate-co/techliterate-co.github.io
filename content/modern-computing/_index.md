Before we can explore networks, cybersecurity, or programming, we need to make
sure we’re standing on the same ground. Every modern technology—from cloud
services to mobile apps—ultimately depends on two essentials: **hardware** and
**operating systems**. Hardware provides the physical machinery; the operating
system is the software layer that brings that machinery to life. Together, they
form the foundation of all computing.

In this chapter, we’ll look closely at the key hardware components—CPU, memory,
storage, and input/output devices—and explain how they work together to process
information. We’ll also dive into the role of the operating system, with an
emphasis on the “big three” platforms you’re most likely to encounter:
Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux. Along the way, we’ll also give
honorable mention to FreeBSD, an OS with a smaller market share but a
surprisingly large influence on modern technology.

For some learners, these concepts may feel familiar. You may have already used
different operating systems or know the basic idea of what a CPU or RAM does.
But part of becoming truly confident in technology is being able to **explain**
these systems clearly and use the right vocabulary. This chapter is designed to
bring everyone to a shared level of understanding, regardless of your
background.

To reinforce your learning, you’ll complete a **lab exercise** where you’ll
explore the hardware and operating system details of your own computer. You’ll
also test your knowledge with a **quiz** designed to check comprehension and
make sure the fundamentals are solid. The combination of explanation, hands-on
practice, and self-assessment will prepare you to build toward more advanced
topics in later chapters.

The key takeaway is this: a strong foundation makes everything else easier. By
the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to describe the major components of a
computer, explain what an operating system does, and recognize the strengths
and weaknesses of the most common platforms. With this shared understanding in
place, we’ll be ready to tackle the bigger, more complex topics that lie ahead.
