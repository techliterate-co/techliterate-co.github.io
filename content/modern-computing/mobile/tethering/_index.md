Tethering and using a Wi-Fi hotspot are two closely related, but distinct,
methods for sharing a mobile device's internet connection. At its core,
**tethering** refers to the general process of sharing an internet connection
from one device to another. This can be done in several ways, including through
a wired USB cable, a wireless Bluetooth connection, or by creating a Wi-Fi
network. The term itself is often used broadly to encompass all three methods.
The key idea behind tethering is that the host device (usually a smartphone)
becomes the source of an internet connection for a client device, bypassing the
need for a traditional Wi-Fi network.

A **Wi-Fi hotspot**, on the other hand, is a specific *type* of tethering. It
is the most common and popular method because it uses the mobile device's
built-in Wi-Fi capabilities to create a personal wireless access point. When a
Wi-Fi hotspot is enabled, the phone broadcasts its own Wi-Fi signal, which
other devices can then detect and connect to just as they would with a home or
public Wi-Fi network.  This method is convenient because it's wireless and can
support multiple devices simultaneously, making it ideal for sharing an
internet connection with a group of friends or between a laptop and a tablet.

The primary difference lies in the connection method. While a Wi-Fi hotspot
relies on a wireless signal, tethering also includes wired and Bluetooth
options. **USB tethering** involves connecting a phone to a laptop or computer
directly with a USB cable. This creates a more stable, faster, and often more
secure connection than Wi-Fi, as the data travels directly between the two
devices. A major benefit of USB tethering is that it can also charge the
phone's battery while sharing the internet connection, preventing the rapid
battery drain that is common with Wi-Fi hotspots. 

Another method is **Bluetooth tethering**, which uses Bluetooth technology to
connect a single client device to the internet through the mobile phone. While
Bluetooth tethering is typically slower than both Wi-Fi and USB, it uses
significantly less battery power. This makes it a great option for light
internet use, such as checking emails, when battery life is a concern. The
major limitation is that most Bluetooth tethering setups only allow a single
device to be connected at a time, making it less practical for sharing the
connection with multiple devices simultaneously.

In summary, tethering is the overarching term for sharing an internet
connection, while a Wi-Fi hotspot is just one of the tethering methods
available. The choice between a hotspot, USB, or Bluetooth tethering depends on
the user's specific needs. A Wi-Fi hotspot is best for sharing with multiple
devices and provides a good balance of speed and convenience. USB tethering is
ideal for a single-device connection where speed and battery life are critical,
and Bluetooth tethering is a good low-power option for basic tasks.
Understanding these differences allows users to choose the most efficient and
effective method for their situation.
