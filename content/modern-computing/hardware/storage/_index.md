**Computer storage** is where a computer keeps data for long-term use. Unlike
RAM, which is temporary, storage devices hold information even when the
computer is turned off. Think of storage as the computer's long-term memory or
a filing cabinet where all your files, programs, and the operating system
itself are kept safe. Whenever you save a document, download a program, or
install a game, that data is being written to a storage device. Without
storage, your computer would have to be re-installed from scratch every time
you turned it on.

There are two main types of storage devices in modern computers: **Hard Disk
Drives (HDDs)** and **Solid-State Drives (SSDs)**.  An **HDD** is an older
technology that uses spinning metal platters and a read/write head to store and
retrieve data magnetically, similar to a record player. They are generally
slower but offer a lot of storage capacity for a low price, making them a good
choice for storing large files like movies and photos. An **SSD** is a newer
technology that uses flash memory chips to store data electronically. Because
it has no moving parts, an SSD is much faster, more durable, and consumes less
power than an HDD.

Storage devices connect to the **motherboard** via cables (like SATA or NVMe)
that allow them to transfer data to and from the other components, especially
the CPU. When you open a file, the CPU requests the data from the storage
drive, which then retrieves it and sends it to the RAM for the CPU to work
with. The speed and capacity of your storage are very important for a
computer's overall performance. A fast SSD can dramatically reduce boot-up
times and the time it takes for applications to load, making the entire
computer feel much more responsive and quick. Having enough storage capacity
ensures you have room for all your files and applications without constantly
having to delete things.
