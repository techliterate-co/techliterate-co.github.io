When a mobile device is used as a Wi-Fi hotspot, it essentially acts as a
mini-router, allowing other devices like laptops or tablets to connect to the
internet using the phone's cellular data plan. This process, often called
**tethering**, is incredibly useful when you're in an area without a public or
private Wi-Fi network. Instead of relying on a physical router, your
smartphone's cellular chip connects to the internet via the nearest cell tower,
and its Wi-Fi chip then broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal. This allows you to share
your mobile data connection with other devices, creating a small, personal
local area network.

On **iOS**, the feature is called "Personal Hotspot" and is also available in
the main "Settings" menu. Users can customize the network name and password to
ensure security. An added feature on iOS is the ability to connect to the
hotspot via Bluetooth or a USB cable in addition to Wi-Fi. This offers a more
direct and often more stable connection for a single device, while still using
the phone's cellular data.

On **Android**, this feature is called "Portable Hotspot" or "Wi-Fi Hotspot"
and can be found in the device's settings under "Network & Internet." Users can
easily turn the feature on and off with a single toggle. The user can also
customize the hotspot's name (SSID) and set a secure password to prevent
unauthorized access. The Android operating system also provides options to
manage connected devices and can even turn off the hotspot automatically after
a period of inactivity to save battery. This flexibility makes it a seamless
way to share an internet connection with any nearby device.
