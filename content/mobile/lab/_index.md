### Lab 2: Mobile Security & Updates

#### Objective
In this lab, you'll learn the critical importance of keeping your mobile device
and its applications up to date. You will check for, and apply, all available
operating system and app updates to ensure your device is patched and secure.

---

#### Introduction
Think of your phone's software as its immune system. When a bug or a security
flaw is found, developers release a "patch" to fix the problem. Staying up to
date is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself from
security threats and ensure your device runs as smoothly as possible. Your task
is to perform a full security and performance checkup on your mobile device.

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
Before you begin, make sure you have your mobile device and a strong Wi-Fi
connection. It's a good idea to plug your device into a charger as well, as
some updates can take a while and drain your battery.

**Step 2: Update Your Operating System**
* **On Android:** Go to "Settings," scroll down to "System" or "About Phone," then tap "System Update" or "Software Update." The exact path may vary slightly by manufacturer.
* **On iOS:** Go to "Settings," tap "General," and then select "Software Update."
* Follow the on-screen instructions to check for and install any available updates. This process may require you to restart your device. 

**Step 3: Update Your Applications**
* **On Android:** Open the "Google Play Store" app. Tap your profile icon (in the top right), then select "Manage apps & devices." You should see an option to update all apps or a list of apps with available updates.
* **On iOS:** Open the "App Store" app. Tap your profile icon (in the top right). Scroll down to see pending updates.
* Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install all pending application updates.

**Step 4: Verify Your Status**
After all updates have been installed, go back to the software update section
of your settings (Step 2) and confirm that your device is up to date. Then, go
back to the app store update section (Step 3) and confirm that all of your apps
are also up to date.

**Step 5: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your experience during the
lab.

1.  What operating system and version did your phone have before the update, and what version did it have after?
2.  How many applications did you have to update? Were there any apps you were surprised to see needed an update?
3.  Based on this lab, why do you think it is so important for people to turn on automatic updates for their devices and applications?

**Step 6: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your findings in a text file or a
document and submit it as instructed.
