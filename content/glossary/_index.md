## 💻 Modern Computing
-   **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" of a computer, responsible for executing instructions and processing data.
-   **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: A type of temporary, volatile memory used to store data that the CPU needs to access quickly.
-   **Storage**: The non-volatile component of a computer that stores data for long-term use (e.g., SSDs and HDDs).
-   **Operating System (OS)**: The core software that manages all the hardware and software resources of a computer system and provides a platform for applications to run on.

## 📱 Mobile Devices
-   **Android**: A mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
-   **iOS**: A mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware, including the iPhone and iPad.
-   **App Store**: A digital distribution platform for mobile applications, often specific to a particular mobile operating system (e.g., Apple's App Store, Google Play Store).
-   **Touchscreen**: An input device that allows users to interact with a display by using their fingers or a stylus.

## 🌐 Computer Networking
-   **Router**: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks, acting as the traffic manager of a network.
-   **Wi-Fi**: A wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or communicate with one another without physical cables.
-   **Ethernet**: A family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used to connect devices in local area networks (LANs).
-   **IP Address**: A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

## 🔒 Cybersecurity
-   **Malware**: Short for "malicious software," it's any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, or network.
-   **Phishing**: A type of cyber attack in which an attacker tricks a user into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by impersonating a trustworthy entity.
-   **Firewall**: A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
-   **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.

## ☁️ Cloud Computing
-   **Cloud**: A network of remote servers hosted on the internet and used to store, manage, and process data instead of a local server or a personal computer.
-   **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: A software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the internet (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft 365).
-   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: A type of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking (e.g., Amazon Web Services).
-   **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: A cloud computing model that provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure (e.g., Heroku).

## 🐍 Python Programming
-   **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in a specific programming language.
-   **Variable**: A named storage location in a program that holds a value, which can be changed.
-   **Function**: A block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
-   **Library**: A collection of pre-written functions and modules that can be used to perform specific tasks, saving a programmer from having to write code from scratch.

---

## 🤖 AI & IoT
-   **IoT (Internet of Things)**: A network of physical objects ("things") embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.
-   **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
-   **Machine Learning**: A subfield of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed, often using statistical techniques to find patterns in data.
-   **Neural Network**: A series of algorithms that mimic the human brain's ability to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.
