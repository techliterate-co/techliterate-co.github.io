What is the best definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

> AI is a broad field of study that focuses on creating intelligent machines.

- [ ] A type of computer that is powered by human emotions.
- [ ] A computer program that can only perform a single, fixed task.
- [ ] A database that stores a large amount of information for a computer.
- [x] The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## Machine Learning

What is a key difference between a traditional computer program and a Machine Learning model?

> Think about how each one learns to perform a task.

- [ ] A traditional program can learn from data, while a Machine Learning model cannot.
- [ ] A traditional program is always faster than a Machine Learning model.
- [x] A traditional program follows explicit instructions, while a Machine Learning model learns patterns from data to make decisions.
- [ ] Machine Learning models are not considered a part of AI.

What is the main goal of **prompt engineering**?

> This practice is essential for getting the best results from a large language model.

- [ ] To write code for a new software program.
- [x] To craft effective instructions and questions to get a desired response from an AI model.
- [ ] To create the ethical guidelines for a new AI system.
- [ ] To physically build a new AI-powered robot.

## Ethical Concerns

---
shuffle_answers: true
---

A major ethical concern with AI is **algorithmic bias**. What is the most common cause of this bias?

> Think about the data used to train the AI model.

- [ ] The physical size of the AI hardware.
- [x] Flaws or prejudices present in the data used to train the model.
- [ ] A computer virus that infects the AI system.
- [ ] The lack of a strong internet connection.

## Large Language Models

---

---

What is a **Large Language Model (LLM)**?

> A chatbot like ChatGPT is a well-known example of an LLM.

- [ ] A program that can only translate text from one language to another.
- [ ] An AI that is designed to create images from text.
- [ ] A type of AI that can only perform mathematical calculations.
- [x] An AI model trained on a massive amount of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

---
shuffle_answers: true
---

When writing a prompt for an AI, which of these practices will likely get you the best result?

> The clearer you are, the better the AI can respond.

- [ ] Using vague and open-ended questions.
- [ ] Including as many different topics as possible in a single prompt.
- [x] Providing clear, specific instructions and examples.
- [ ] Writing the prompt as a single, long paragraph without formatting.

## AI vs. Human

---
shuffle_answers: false
---

True or False: An AI can have feelings, beliefs, and a genuine understanding of the world, just like a human.

> AI systems are based on algorithms and data, not consciousness.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## AI Hallucinations

---
shuffle_answers: true
---

In the context of AI, what is a **hallucination**?

> This is a common issue with large language models.

- [ ] When an AI model generates an image from a text prompt.
- [ ] A feature of an AI system that allows it to create art.
- [x] When an AI model confidently generates false or nonsensical information.
- [ ] A type of malware that tricks an AI model.

## The "Black Box" Problem

---
shuffle_answers: false
---

The ethical challenge of AI models being too complex for humans to understand how they reached a certain conclusion is known as what?

> This is often called the "black box" problem.

- [ ] Algorithmic bias
- [ ] Data privacy
- [x] AI explainability
- [ ] Prompt engineering

## Generative AI

---
shuffle_answers: true
---

What is the primary function of **generative AI**?

> Think about AI models that create new content, like images or text.

- [ ] To perform simple arithmetic calculations.
- [x] To create new content or data, such as images, text, or music.
- [ ] To manage and organize a computer's file system.
- [ ] To act as a search engine for finding information on the web.
