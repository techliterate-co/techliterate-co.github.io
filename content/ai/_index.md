Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in
machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems like humans.
AI encompasses fields like computer and data science, utilizing concepts like
neural networks and machine learning to develop systems that can perceive,
reason, and act, with notable applications in everyday life, such as digital
assistants, navigation apps, and fraud detection systems.
