### Lab 7: The Art of Prompt Engineering

#### Objective

In this lab, you will become a **prompt engineer**\! You will learn how to
write effective and clear prompts to get better, more useful responses from a
large language model (LLM). You will apply best practices for providing
context, a role, and clear instructions to an AI.

-----

#### Introduction

Think of an AI as a brilliant but slightly confused new colleague. If you give
it a vague request, you'll get a vague answer. But if you give it a clear set
of instructions, a defined purpose, and some context, it can produce amazing
results. **Prompt engineering** is the art of giving an AI model exactly what
it needs to succeed. Your task today is to experiment with different prompts to
see how small changes can lead to huge improvements.

-----

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Get Started**
You will need access to a large language model. The easiest way to get started
is to use a free tool like **Gemini** (`gemini.google.com`) or **ChatGPT**
(`chat.openai.com`).

**Step 2: The "Bad" Prompt**
Let's start by trying a bad prompt. In the chat window, type the following
vague request and send it:
`Write something about space.`
Observe the response. It's likely very generic and not particularly useful.

**Step 3: The "Good" Prompt**
Now, let's try a much better prompt. Copy and paste the following into the chat
window and send it:

```
**Prompt:** Write a short, engaging, two-paragraph explanation of the James
Webb Space Telescope's purpose, written for an audience of high school
students. The explanation should use an analogy to help the students understand
how the telescope "sees."
```

Compare this response to the first one. It should be much more specific,
helpful, and tailored to a specific audience.

**Step 4: Your Turn - The "Role" Prompt**
Now it's your turn to be the prompt engineer. You will write three different
prompts for the same goal, each with a different "role." Your goal is to get a
short biography of Albert Einstein.

  * **Prompt 1 (The Historian):** Write a prompt that asks the AI to act as a historian.
  * **Prompt 2 (The Scientist):** Write a prompt that asks the AI to act as a quantum physicist.
  * **Prompt 3 (The Journalist):** Write a prompt that asks the AI to act as a journalist for a science magazine.
  * **Your Prompts Here:**
    ```
    Prompt 1:
    [Your prompt here]

    Prompt 2:
    [Your prompt here]

    Prompt 3:
    [Your prompt here]
    ```

**Step 5: Answer the Questions**
Finally, answer the following questions based on your experience during the
lab.

1.  What was the main difference between the AI's response to your "Bad" prompt and your "Good" prompt?
2.  Review the three responses you got from the "Role" prompts (Historian, Scientist, Journalist). How did each response change based on the role you assigned?
3.  Based on your findings, what is your biggest takeaway about the importance of prompt engineering?

**Step 6: Submission**
Once you have completed all the steps, save your prompts and your answers in a
document and submit it as instructed.

#### Good luck, and happy prompting\!
