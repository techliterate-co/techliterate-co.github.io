### **The Enterprise Giant**

If AWS is the landlord of the internet, Microsoft Azure is the office manager
for the world's biggest corporations. While Amazon started as a bookstore,
Microsoft has been putting computers on office desks since the 1980s. This gave
them a massive advantage when they entered the cloud market: they already had
relationships with almost every business on Earth. For companies that already
use Windows, Outlook, and Excel, moving to Azure feels less like renting a new
apartment and more like unlocking a new room in a house they already own.

Microsoft is obsessed with physical reach, and it shows in their map. Azure
operates in **over 60 geographic regions**, which is actually more than AWS.
This "everywhere" strategy is a huge selling point for multinational companies
that need to keep their data close to their offices in specific countries due
to legal laws or speed requirements. Within these regions, they operate **over
113 Availability Zones**, ensuring that, like AWS, a power outage in one
building doesn't take down your entire business.

In terms of what you can actually *do* on Azure, the menu is just as massive.
They offer **hundreds of distinct services**, covering everything from basic
virtual hard drives to advanced "Internet of Things" tools that can track
shipping containers or monitor factory machines. However, their biggest claim
to fame recently is Artificial Intelligence. Through their partnership with
OpenAI (the creators of ChatGPT), Azure has become the go-to cloud for
companies wanting to build smart apps. If a company is adding an AI chatbot to
their customer service, there is a very good chance it is running on Azure.

Financially, Azure is catching up fast. While they don't always report numbers
the exact same way Amazon does, recent reports from 2025 indicate that the
Azure cloud business has surpassed an **annual revenue run rate of $75
billion**. When you combine this with their other server software (a segment
they call the "Intelligent Cloud"), that number shoots up to over $120 billion.
This makes them a financial titan that is nearly as large as AWS, driven
largely by big contracts with Fortune 500 companies.

In the race for market share, Microsoft is the clear runner-up, holding
approximately **23% of the global market**. While they are still in second
place behind Amazon, they are widely considered the strongest challenger. They
have successfully carved out a reputation as the "hybrid" cloud—the best choice
for companies that want to keep some servers in their own basement while moving
others to the cloud. This strategy has helped them steadily eat away at
Amazon's lead, turning what used to be a one-horse race into a fierce rivalry.
