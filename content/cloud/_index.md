Technical definitions of Cloud Computing usually sound something like this: 'A
paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of
shareable physical resources...'

Boring, right? We aren’t going to talk about that. Today, we’re going to talk
about Pizza.

Believe it or not, the different ways you might order a pizza also represent
the Cloud Service Models.

Let's look at the three methods you could use:

Group 1: The Delivery Squad. You go online, order Domino’s, and wait. You
don’t shop for ingredients, you don’t knead dough, and you don’t preheat an
oven. You wanted a result delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less.

Group 2: The Take-and-Bake Crew. You go to Papa Murphy’s. You buy a
pre-assembled pizza, but you take it home to bake it yourself. You were fine
handing over the hard work (sourcing ingredients and prep), but you wanted
control over the final execution—maybe you like it extra crispy.

Group 3: The DIY Chefs. You have the equipment, the ingredients, and the
patience. You controll every single component, from the flour ratio in the
dough to the temperature of the oven.

These three groups represent the three primary cloud service models: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

1. SaaS (Software as a Service) – The Delivery.

The Analogy: Just like ordering Domino’s, you consume the product without
worrying about how it was made.

The Tech: You use the software, but manage nothing. Think Netflix, Gmail, or Microsoft 365. You pay a subscription, and it just works.

2. PaaS (Platform as a Service) – The Take-and-Bake.

The Analogy: The vendor provides the raw structure (the pre-made pizza), but
you handle the final execution (the baking).

The Tech: You focus on building applications (the code), while the vendor
handles the hardware and operating systems. You bring the code; they provide
the platform to run it.

3. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – The DIY Chef.

The Analogy: You do it yourself. You have full control over the ingredients and
the process, provided you have the kitchen to do it in.

The Tech: You rent the raw hardware (servers, storage, networking) and you are
responsible for everything on top of it: installing the OS, patching security
holes, and managing data.

The Key Takeaway: The difference comes down to Control vs. Convenience.

IaaS: I manage everything (Infrastructure).

PaaS: I manage the programs (Platform).

SaaS: I pay for a subscription (Software).
