![There is no cloud](/fundamentals/img/there-is-no-cloud.png)

Cloud computing is a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and
elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources physically stored in a
data-center.

But we're not going to talk about that. Today we're going to talk about your assignment to eat pizza before class.

Again, it didn't matter where or how you procured or prepared the pizza, but hopefully you were able to complete it. Easiest homework ever, am I right?

And, yes, we're going to use pizza to teach you key cloud paradigms.

In this section we're going to compare the different means and methods that we each took to procure or prepare a pizza.

Some percentage of the students will get online and order delivery. Dominoes or the like.

Others will use a take-and-bake service, like Pappa Murphy's, to order but then heat the pizza at home later.

This group is fine handing over some control of the process, but not all of it. They likely have preferences on heat and cook times.

Maybe they like their 'za extra crispy. Who knows.

Then there will be the students that make their own pizza.

They have the equipment. They have the ingredients. They have the time and patience.

These students have complete control over every compontent of the process. From sourcing ingredients to preparation to baking.

How does this compare with the other two groups?

The first group gets online and orders Dominoes to be delivered. They are not (and likely don't want to be) involved in procuring ingredients.

They likely don't care to be involved in the preparation process, or the baking or for that matter even the delivery.

These students want a pizza magically delivered to their front door in thirty minutes or less!

These three groups represent the key principles described in the three core cloud paradigms.

SaaS - this is the first group. 30 minutes or its free, zero work done by me!

PaaS - this is the take-and-bake group. ingredients and preparation by them, producing a cooked pizza by you.

IaaS - this is the third group. diy. full control. when provided with raw infrastructure, you can bake so much pizza!

The key difference is that IaaS is for building infrastructure, PaaS is for building applications, while SaaS is for using pre-built applications.

Another key difference is the decreasing level of user control and management responsibility from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS.

In an IaaS the customer chooses from available hardware, selects operating system, manages patches, manages data integrity and privacy and handles networking.

In a PaaS the customer simply selects a SDK (programming language) and begins developing code, without the hassle of hardware, OS, patching, or data management.I

In a SaaS the customer simply uses the service. You could also think of it as "service as a subscription", ie; Netflix, Microsoft 365, YouTube, Twitch, etc.

So I remember it like this:
IaaS - **I** manage everything, 
PaaS - I manage **programs** but don’t manage the infrastructure, 
SaaS - I pay for a **subscription** to a service.

* Remember: if you don't pay for the product (or you run it yourself in an IaaS or self-hosted), then you **are** the product.

That's, at a high level, the definition of the cloud as taught by last week's assignment, eating pizza.

You were learning and didn't even know it yet. That's gotta be gold star worthy for this instructor! :star:

So, let's give you some examples of how the cloud services you might be familiar with fall into these three categories.

Multiple choice game:

Netflix - *SaaS/IaaS/PaaS?
Gmail - *SaaS/IaaS/PaaS?
Amazon EC2 - IaaS
Amazon S3 - IaaS
Google App Engine - PaaS
Digital Ocean - IaaS
Microsoft Azure - IaaS
Rackspace
VMware
Joyent
Salesforce
DocuSign
Dropbox
Heroku
IBM Cloud
