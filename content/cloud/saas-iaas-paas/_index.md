SaaS stands for Software as a Service, a cloud computing model where a provider
hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the internet on a
subscription basis. Instead of buying and installing software on local devices,
users access and use the software via a web browser or mobile app. Key benefits
include automatic updates, reduced IT costs, and the ability to access
applications from any internet-connected device.  

PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a cloud computing service that provides a
complete, on-demand environment for developing, running, and managing
applications. Instead of buying and managing the underlying hardware and
software, developers use a cloud provider's platform to build and deploy
applications. 


IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service, is a cloud computing model that provides
on-demand access to virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and
networking over the internet. Essentially, it's like renting a data center
infrastructure rather than building and maintaining your own. Customers can
then use these resources to run their applications and workloads without the
burden of managing the underlying physical hardware.
