You're writing a Python program to perform a complex task. What is a best practice for writing code that other people (or you later on) can easily understand and maintain?

> Think about how you would make a document easier for someone else to read and understand.

- [ ] Use single-letter variable names to make the code shorter.
- [ ] Avoid using any comments to keep the code clean.
- [ ] Write all of your code in one long line to save space.
- [x] Use descriptive variable names, clear function names, and add comments to explain complex logic.

## Mobile App Permissions

---

You download a new app on your phone that requests permissions to access your photos, contacts, and microphone, but it is a simple game. From a privacy standpoint, what is the best practice to follow?

> Think about the principle of 'least privilege' for applications.

- [ ] Grant all permissions so the app works correctly.
- [ ] Immediately delete the app as it must be malicious.
- [x] Grant only the permissions the app needs to function and deny all others.
- [ ] Ignore the permission request and use the app anyway.

## Preventing AI Bias

---

---

When training an AI model, what is a crucial best practice to prevent the model from exhibiting harmful **algorithmic bias**?

> The quality of the AI's output is highly dependent on the quality of its input.

- [ ] Only use AI models that have been previously trained on the internet.
- [ ] Train the model on a small, unrepresentative dataset.
- [ ] Use a dataset that is as small as possible to reduce training time.
- [x] Ensure the training data is diverse, comprehensive, and representative of different groups of people.

## Computer Bottleneck

---
shuffle_answers: true
---

Your computer is running very slowly, even with only one program open. After checking the CPU and RAM, you see that both are at low usage. What is a likely bottleneck causing the slow performance?

> Think about where data is stored for the long term.

- [x] A very old, slow hard disk drive (HDD) that is taking a long time to load programs.
- [ ] The power supply unit is not providing enough power to the CPU.
- [ ] There is a problem with the monitor.
- [ ] The network cable is unplugged.

## Secure Browsing

---
shuffle_answers: true

From a networking and security perspective, what is a best practice to protect your personal data when using an unsecured public Wi-Fi network?

> This tool encrypts your connection.

- [ ] Turn off your computer's firewall.
- [ ] Only browse websites that start with "http://".
- [x] Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.
- [ ] Connect to the network using a static IP address.

## Managing I/O

---
shuffle_answers: false
---

Your computer's CPU, RAM, and storage are all very fast, but opening files from an external hard drive is still slow. What is the most likely cause?

> The connection to the device can be a bottleneck.

- [ ] The computer's operating system needs to be updated.
- [ ] The RAM is not large enough.
- [ ] The hard drive is not fast enough.
- [x] The I/O connection (e.g., the USB port or cable) is a bottleneck that is limiting the data transfer speed.

## Code Security

---
shuffle_answers: false
---

You are writing a Python program that connects to a database. What is the best practice for handling a password that the program needs to use?

> Hardcoding secrets is a bad practice.

- [ ] Hardcode the password directly into the source code so it is always available.
- [ ] Store the password in a text file on your desktop.
- [ ] Give the program administrative permissions to access the password from anywhere.
- [x] Store the password securely in an encrypted file or environment variable and have the program access it from there.
