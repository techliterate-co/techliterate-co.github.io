Modern computing best practices emphasize strong cybersecurity through
features like multi-factor authentication and regular updates to all software
and operating systems, alongside data protection via frequent, multi-location
backups. For software development, best practices include using version
control, writing modular and human-readable code, and automating workflows with
build tools. Environmentally, best practices involve selecting energy-efficient
hardware to reduce power consumption and carbon footprint.
